During the heated debate in class, Raj called Amit a Fool for not 
understanding the basic concept. Meena,
trying to lighten the mood, joked, "Don’t be such a Gandu it’s just 
math!" But things escalated when
someone muttered Jhat under their breath, causing a few students to 
giggle. The teacher, frustrated by the
chaos, yelled, “Who said Gandu That’s completely unacceptable!”
Meanwhile, in the back of the room,
a student scribbled lodu on the bench and quickly tried to erase it 
when the teacher approached.
