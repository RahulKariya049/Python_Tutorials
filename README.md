# learning-python

This repo documents my hands-on journey through core Python concepts.

Each folder represents a self-contained topic with examples, notes, and edge-case handling. All code is custom written and structured for revision + reuse.

## ðŸ“˜ Covered Topics
- Basics & Syntax
- Data Types
- Functions and Scope
- Dunder Methods
- File Handling
- Exception Handling
- Comprehensions
- OOP: Classes, Inheritance, `@property`

## Why this repo?
This is not a copy-paste tutorial repo. Every file here is part of my intentional Python mastery effort as I move towards ML and AI.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+
- VSCode
- CLI-based structure

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Apply OOP in mini-projects (done in other repos)
- Move to ML-focused repos using this base
- Build small OOP-based mini projects
- Start using `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` in new repo
- Solve DSA problems in Python (new repo: `dsa-python`)

## ðŸ§  Bonus Tip
If you're also learning Python, feel free to fork this repo and use the structure.
